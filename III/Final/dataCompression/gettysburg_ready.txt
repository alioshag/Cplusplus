FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO OUR FATHERS BROUGHT FORTH , UPON THIS CONTINENT , A NEW NATION , CONCEIVED IN LIBERTY , AND DEDICATED TO THE PROPOSITION THAT "ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL" NOW WE ARE ENGAGED IN A GREAT CIVIL WAR , TESTING WHETHER THAT NATION , OR ANY NATION SO CONCEIVED , AND SO DEDICATED , CAN LONG ENDURE . WE ARE MET ON A GREAT BATTLE FIELD OF THAT WAR . WE HAVE COME TO DEDICATE A PORTION OF IT , AS A FINAL RESTING PLACE FOR THOSE WHO DIED HERE , THAT THE NATION MIGHT LIVE . THIS WE MAY , IN ALL PROPRIETY DO . BUT , IN A LARGER SENSE , WE CAN NOT DEDICATE  -  - WE CAN NOT CONSECRATE  -  - WE CAN NOT HALLOW , THIS GROUND -  - THE BRAVE MEN , LIVING AND DEAD , WHO STRUGGLED HERE , HAVE HALLOWED IT , FAR ABOVE OUR POOR POWER TO ADD OR DETRACT . THE WORLD WILL LITTLE NOTE , NOR LONG REMEMBER WHAT WE SAY HERE ; WHILE IT CAN NEVER FORGET WHAT THEY DID HERE . IT IS RATHER FOR US , THE LIVING , TO STAND HERE , WE HERE BE DEDICA - TED TO THE GREAT TASK REMAINING BEFORE US  -  - THAT , FROM THESE HONORED DEAD WE TAKE INCREASED DEVOTION TO THAT CAUSE FOR WHICH THEY HERE , GAVE THE LAST FULL MEASURE OF DEVOTION  -  - THAT WE HERE HIGHLY RESOLVE THESE DEAD SHALL NOT HAVE DIED IN VAIN ; THAT THE NATION , SHALL HAVE A NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM , AND THAT GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE , SHALL NOT PERISH FROM THE EARTH .
